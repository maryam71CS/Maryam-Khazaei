		<h3>Course & Projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>Lane Systems of Max lows, Application: Controlling and Management of Traffic Flow, May 2020-Spring 2021, UC Merced</b> <br>

				to a sink polygonal exit. Our proposed method addresses lane systems that 1) are collision-free among planar polygonal obstacles,</b> <br>
				2) maintain a given clearance from other lanes and obstacles, and 3) are of maximum flow <br>
