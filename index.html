		<h3>Course & Projects</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> <b> Multi-Robot Path Optimization "Path Smoothing with Deterministic Shortcuts", Jun 2021 - March 2022, UC Merced </b> <br>
			We generate and develop algorithms using RRT-based path planning application to optimize lanes for Multi-Robots in terms of smoothing and </b> <br>
			shortening lanes/paths which is going to be collision free. Some of these algorithms that are generated include Corner smoothing Method, </b> <br>
			Max Sub-Path Method, Max Shortcut Method, Max- Radius Method, Subdivision Method. <br>
			</li>

			<li> <b>Lane Systems of Max lows, Application: Controlling and Management of Traffic Flow, May 2020-Spring 2021, UC Merced</b> <br>
				In this project we focus on the problem of planning lane systems to be used by agents moving from a source polygonal entrance </b> <br>
				to a sink polygonal exit. Our proposed method addresses lane systems that 1) are collision-free among planar polygonal obstacles,</b> <br>
				2) maintain a given clearance from other lanes and obstacles, and 3) are of maximum flow <br>
				</li>
			<li> <b> Modeling a Hierarchical Object | UC Merced-Fall 2019 | Course Project (Computer Graphic) </b> <br>
			Implement Modeling a Hierarchical Object includes 5 parts interconnected by joints produce movements in 3 dimensions with two types of global and joint motion.<br>
			tools - CPP, Open GL <br>			
			</li>
			
			<li> <b> Animating a Hierarchical Object | UC Merced-Fall 2019 | Course Project (Computer Graphic) </b> <br>
